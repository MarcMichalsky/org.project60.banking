# Hooks

Some parts of CiviBanking can be customized using hooks. This would typically be done in a dedicated customization
extension. CiviBanking supports the following hooks:

PHP hooks:

* **[hook_civicrm_banking_transaction_summary](hook_civicrm_banking_transaction_summary.md)** - change the summary blocks displayed when reviewing transactions.

JavaScript hooks:

* **[banking_contact_option_element](banking_contact_option_element.md)** - change the label shown for a contact in banking's contact selector.
